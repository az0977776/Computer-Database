# Computer Lab Overview

# Overview
Client: Mr. Dyrland-Weaver

We were assigned with the task of designing a way to keep track of the status of all the computers in school. CS teachers were to be able to view a grid of the computers in each room and view information about them, as well as view a list of all the computers with issues. They were also to be able to add notes that would be collectively viewed by all the teachers.
