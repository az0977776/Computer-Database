# Computer-Lab Check 

#Overview
Mr. DW assigned us with the task of designing a way to keep track of the status of all the computers in school. CS teachers will be able to view a grid of the computers in each room and view information about them as well as a list of all the computers with issues. They will also be able to add notes about the computer rooms for other teachers.
